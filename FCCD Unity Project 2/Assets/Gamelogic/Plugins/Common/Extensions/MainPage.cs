		@mainpage_Extensions Gamelogic Extensions for Unity API Documentation

		This extension library contains a few light-weight utility classes and
		convenient extension methods for some Unity classes.	

		@version 1.2

		(Note, this library also comes with other %Gamelogic Unity plugins).

		The library contains:
			- A base class for creating Singletons from any MonoBehaviour. See @ref Singleton<T>.
			- A light-weight state machine class. See @ref StateMachine<TLabel>.
			- A monobehaviour class that defines generic methods for Instantiation. 
				See @ref GLMonoBehaviour.
			- A PlayerPrefs alternative that, in addition to the methods of the standard 
				PlayerPrefs, also defines methods for dealing with boolean types, and rays 
				of int, float, string and bool. See @ref GLPlayerPrefs.
			- Extensions for transform that allows easy setting of components of position, 
				scale and rotation separately. See @ref TransformExtensions.
			- Extensions for vectors to calculate the projection and rejection, and the 
				vector perpendicular (2D). See @ref VectorExtensions.
			- Extensions for Colors to get lighter or darker colors, get a color with 
				a given value, and get an opaque version of a given color. See @ref ColorExtensions.
