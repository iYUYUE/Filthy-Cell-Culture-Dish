		Interface for working with compound points.

		Spliced points are used for periodic grids where not all
		faces are identical (see AbstractSplicedGrid). 

		Every spliced grid can be seen as a uniform regular grid, 
		where each cell has been divided. Therefore, a spliced point
		consists of a coordinate on the base grid, and an index denoting 
		the particular cell.

		@tparam TPoint the type that implements this interface
		@tparam TBasePoint the type of the refular grid that underlies this grid. For example, 
			a hexagonal grid underlies regular triangular grids
