		Represents a "point" that is used to access a cell in a Grid. 

		For built-in 2D grids, these points are often 2D integer vectors, or spliced vectors, and hence they implement 
		additional interfaces such as IVectorPoint, ISplicedPoint, andISplicedVectorPoint. These points supports 
		arithmetic, [colorings](http://gamelogic.co.za/2013/12/18/what-are-grid-colorings/), and some other geometric operations. 

		In general, points do not "know" their neighbors. Use the grid methods IGrid<TCell, TPoint>.GetNeighbors and 
		IGrid<TCell, TPoint>.GetAllNeighbors to make queries about a point's neighbors.

		@implementers GridPoint base classes must be immutable for many of the algorithms to work correctly. In particular, 
		GridPoints are used as keys in dictionaries and sets.
	
		@implementers It is also a good idea to overload the `==` and `!=` operators.
