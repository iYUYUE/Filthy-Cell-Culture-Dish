		An IMap maps 2D world coordinates to Grid coordinates and vice versa. 
	
		Most of the methods of this class are meant to be chained to the constructor. The last command
		in the chain is suaully a conversion to IMap3D, which converts the 2D coordinates to 3D for use 
		in the game engine.

		
	@link_woking_with_maps.

		The order of chained calls sometimes make a difference.

		The standard order is this:
			- set grid point transforms
			- set cell anchoring
			- set world transforms (such as translate, rotate)
			- do layout (using WithWindow)
			- convert to 3D

		Transformations only apply to the world points returned and processed by the map, 
		the grid contents is not transformed.

		For example, applying scale to the map, will not scale the cells <emph>physically</emph>, in the sense 
		that if the grid contains GameObjects, cells will remain the same size. The cells will be logically bigger,
		so they will appear further apart from each other.

		Built-in 2D grids generally have associated built-in maps. See the [Grid Index](http://gamelogic.co.za/grids/quick-start-tutorial/grid-index/) 
		for the list.

		You can also provide your own maps, either as implementations of IMap, or IMap3D.
