		A partial vector point is a point that can be translated by "adding" a vector point.

		Partial vectors can be seen as a pair, one of which is a vector (of type TVectorPoint).
		All the operations actually operate on the vector of this pair.

		Partial vector points are used in SplicedGrids, where the second of the pair is an index 
		that denotes the sub-cell. For example, for a tri point, the vector is a hex point, and
		the index denotes whether the point refers to the up or down triangle.

		\param TPoint The type that implements this interface.
		\param TVectorPoint The type used to translate TPoints.
