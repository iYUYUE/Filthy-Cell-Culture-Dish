/**
	@mainpage Grids API Documentation
	
Grids is a library for Unity Game Engine that allows you to setup 
	a variety of grids rapidly. It supports a variety of grid types, 
	including hexagonal and triangular grids. Itâ€™s easy to set 
	your grid up in some standard shapes, to combine shapes, or to define your own. It 
	comes with functionality to easily map grid coordinates to game space: center your 
	grid in a rectangle or align it to an edge. It's easy to flip coordinates, or 
	rotate them so that they conform to your intuition. We designed the library with an
	eye on 2D games, but the grids work just as well in 3D. 

	This is the API documentation. For tutorials and other documentation, 
	see: http://gamelogic.co.za/documentation-contents/ .

	For a visual index of grids, see the <a href="http://gamelogic.co.za/grids/quick-start-tutorial/grid-index/">Grid Index</a>.

	@version 1.13

	<h3>Navigating the documentation</h3>
	Grids is a big library, and it can be hard to find functions. It's a good idea to 
    read this guide first: [Introduction and Terminology](http://gamelogic.co.za/grids/documentation-contents/quick-start-tutorial/introduction-and-terminology/) 
	which explains the core concepts. It's important to understand grids, maps, and 
	grid points.

	When browsing the documentation, a good place to start is to look at the methods 
	provided by your particular grid and grid point class (for example RectGrid and 
	RectPoint).
	
	Algorithms contain many of the grid algorithms such as path finding, getting 
	grid points in range, fidinging connected lines, rays and other shapes, and 
	transforming sets of points.
	
	Geometric funtions are usually provided by the point class, unless they rely and
	the particular mapping, in which case they are provided by the map.

			default shape remains a rectangle).
		- Changed some of the shape functions to make it more intuitive "where" a shape will be in relation to the 
			origin.
		- Made static helper functions in the Op classes that were accidentally exposed private. The public geometric functions provided
			by points should be used instead.
		- Improved the AStar algorithm's run speed and its garbage generation.

		- Included compiler hints that can be called to help the AOT compiler include all the necessary code.		

	Version 1.5
		- Fixed a bug in hex maps that caused hexagon grids with non-regular cells not work correctly.
		- Fixed spelling of some enums that contains the word North. This may break your code :/ but we could not
			deprecate the old enums safely.
		- Moved {edge and vertex} code in {rect and diamond} {grid and point} classes into separate files.

	Version 1.4
		- Reorganized the library slightly to make it possible to export different versions
		of it.

	Version 1.3
		- Added geometry calculations for hex points
		- Fixed wrong spelling of some methods that contains the word Middle. Old methods
		have been made obsolete, so this change should not break your code. 
		- Fixed a bug in one of the 3D to 2D extension methods provided form Transform.
		- Lots of small code quality improvements under the hood (including a few optimizations).
