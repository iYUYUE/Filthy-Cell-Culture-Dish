\section{Rationale for Including and Excluding Game Elements}

\subsection{Included}
Those included elements might have slight change, comparing to original design.
	\subsection{Map}
	We used Diamond map instead of Hexmap, because budget constraint. The Hexmap package costs 50 dollars per computer. The game map is limited to be a pure square world instead of cylinder. This is due to data structure constraint. Other aspects are implemented.
	\subsection{Traits Tree}
	We implemented this elements faithfully in most cases, since this is the essential part of gameplay. However, for exploration trait, we use it for deciding population obtained by per exploration and threshold for expanding to nearby cells. The reason is that we did not implement an shadow system.
	\subsection{Camera}
	Zooming in/out and translation of map are all implemented.

	\subsection{Sound Effects}
	We have put a piece of music at the entering of the game, and at the time of winning.
\subsection{Graphics}
We successfully implemented an simple 2D graphical system for our game.

\subsection{Excluded}
Those elements are largely not implemented, mostly because of time limitation.
\subsection{Animations}
We have some sort of ppt like animation for scene besides the main game scene. The two subsection mentioned are not implemented.
\subsubsection{Status Indicating Animation}
We believe it is sufficient to use mixture of color and numerical information to indicate status.

\subsubsection{Declaration of Gaining New Traits}
We achieved this through color and text.

\subsection{Artificial Intelligence}
After some discussions, we found that it should technically feasible to implement it using convolutional network as~\cite{ClarkS14} did for GO.
However, we found it hard to implement an A.I. for this game within the time constraint. 

\subsubsection{Difficulty Choice}
We did not make A.I., therefore it makes little sense to setup difficulty level. Currently, all three difficulty level in the game setting has no effect.

\subsubsection{Other Values' influences}
Again, we don't have A.I..

	\subsection{Networking}
		Not essential to gameplay, therefore we excluded this given time constraint.
