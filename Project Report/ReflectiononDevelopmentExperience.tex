\section{Reflection on Development Experience}

\subsection{Group Working}
It must to be admired that for such project a group of skilled people cooperating with each other is essential since too many different fields of programming and designing are involved. Also, it is important to make clear jobs each individual need to accomplish at the beginning of the project, which not only helps group members to focus on a particular part of works in the developing step, but also decreases the difficulty of later steps of the project such as combining and debugging.

Talking more with group members can help individuals since it is hard for oneself to discover the problems in the thinking or programming processes. We have experienced a lot that someone made silly mistakes but was not aware and other group members corrected it.

\subsection{Developing Tools}
Version control tools such as Github is necessary for group working.
